# Touch'N'Stars: WebApp for Mobile Control of NINA

# 🤝 **Community-Powered, Forever Free: Donate to Cover Apple’s Developer Fee**

Our app is Open Source and will remain so - without advertising, without costs.
In order for it to be available in the Apple App Store, we need an annual developer license of 99 USD, which Apple requires.
Since we do not pursue any commercial interests, we would like to ask you, the community, for support.
If you would like to help us cover the costs, we would be happy about any donation:

Thank you for your support! 💜

### 🚀 **Current Status: Beta Version**  
This web application is in **development phase** and is aimed at astronomy enthusiasts who want to conveniently set up their equipment using the **NINA** (Nighttime Imaging 'N' Astronomy) software via touch devices.  

### 🏁 **Purpose of the WebApp**  
The application aims to make controlling and adjusting already configured profiles easier - directly through a tablet or smartphone. This makes handling more mobile and convenient, especially when setting up equipment and starting imaging sessions.  

### 🧩 **Important Notes**  
- This web app **requires a fully configured and running installation of NINA**.  
- It requires the **Advanced API** plugin in the latest version.
  The API port must be set to 1888 and V2 must be enabled.
- For Three Point Polar Alignment, version 2.2.2.0 or newer is required.
- It is intended as a complement to the desktop software and provides mobile support for basic functions.
- The author assumes no liability
  
### 🔧 **Installation**
- The [Plugin](https://github.com/Touch-N-Stars/N.I.N.A-Plugin-for-Touch-N-Stars) must be installed in NINA
- You may need to allow the application through your Windows firewall.
- Afterwards, Touch'N'Stars can be accessed via http://"NINA-PC-IP":5000.

### 📱 **Android App**
- We have created an app for Android users.
- The [APK file](https://github.com/Touch-N-Stars/Touch-N-Stars/releases) simply needs to be installed on the smartphone or tablet.

### 📱 **iOS App**
- We don't currently have an app for iOS users. 
The hurdles Apple is putting up here are very high and I'm still unsure whether I want to support this company.
- But it also works without a native app, simply in the browser on any iOS device.

### 🧪 **What does the Version offer?**  
- **Mobile Operation**: Easily access NINA through your smartphone or tablet.  
- **User-Friendly Design**: Simple and intuitive interface specifically optimized for mobile devices.  
- **Focus on Practical Features**: Support for essential steps in setting up your equipment.  

### 💙 **Acknowledgements**  
Special thanks go to the entire **NINA** development team, whose excellent work enabled the creation of this web app.  
A special thank you to **Christian**, the developer of the **Advanced API**, for his efforts and support. His work has significantly enabled the development of this web app.
