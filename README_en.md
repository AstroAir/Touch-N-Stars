### 🚀 **Current Status: Beta Version**  
This web application is in **development phase** and is aimed at astronomy enthusiasts who want to conveniently set up their equipment using the **NINA** (Nighttime Imaging 'N' Astronomy) software via touch devices.  

### 🏁 **Purpose of the WebApp**  
The application aims to make controlling and adjusting already configured profiles easier - directly through a tablet or smartphone. This makes handling more mobile and convenient, especially when setting up equipment and starting imaging sessions.  

### 🧩 **Important Notes**  
- This web app **requires a fully configured and running installation of NINA**.  
- It requires the **Advanced API** plugin in the latest beta version.
  The API port must be set to 1888 and V2 must be enabled.
- For Three Point Polar Alignment, version 2.2.2.0 or newer is required.
- It is intended as a complement to the desktop software and provides mobile support for basic functions.
- I assume no liability
  
### 🔧 **Installation**
- The zip file must be extracted on the computer where NINA is installed and TouchNStars.exe must be started.
- You may need to allow the application through the Windows firewall.
- Afterwards, Touch'N'Stars can be accessed via http://"NINA-PC-IP":5000.
